# ChatZone

ChatZone is a simple chat application prototype built with the Quasar Framework (Vue.js).  
It is created as part of the *Web Technologies* course at STU FIIT.

This version represents Phase 1 of the semester project — a clickable, responsive user interface (UI) prototype.  
It includes the main screens of the chat app, but no backend or real-time functionality yet.

## Features (UI Prototype)

- Login Page – form for user login  
- Register Page – form to create a new account  
- Channels Page – shows a list of channels (General, STU FIIT, Random)  
- Chat Page – simple chat conversation between *Valentin* and *Dragomir* inside each channel  

Each page is connected through router navigation, creating a fully clickable SPA (Single Page Application).

## Technologies Used

- Framework: Quasar (Vue.js)  
- Language: JavaScript  
- Architecture: Single Page Application (SPA)  
- Design: Material Design components (Quasar UI)
